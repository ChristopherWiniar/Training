üìä Data Science & Machine Learning Portfolio
Welcome to my personal portfolio! This repository contains a collection of Jupyter Notebooks and projects related to Python, Data Science, and Machine Learning. These files represent both my self-learning journey and materials I've created or adapted to help others learn and explore the field.

While some notebooks are from earlier stages of my development, others showcase more refined and structured projects.

‚≠ê Highlight: S&P 500 Stock Assessment
I highly recommend checking out my S&P 500 stock price analysis and prediction project, which is the most advanced and up-to-date work in this portfolio. It combines:

Real-world data (via Yahoo Finance)

Time series forecasting with LSTM neural networks

Data visualization and preprocessing pipelines

üìÅ What's Inside
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

Machine Learning model training

Deep Learning projects using TensorFlow/Keras

Python scripting for data manipulation

Hands-on exercises for learning and teaching

Feel free to browse through the notebooks. Feedback, suggestions, or collaborations are always welcome!
